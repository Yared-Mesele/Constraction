    <h1>DEFINITION OF CONSTRUCTION</h1>
 <P> Construction means the building of something. This can mean the building of anything from motorways, to an office block, to a brand new cinema. It is happening all around us, all the time.
         The bigger the project, the longer it will take to build, so some construction could last a few weeks, and some could last a few years. There is lots of hard work involved in constructing a building and there are various different stages.
        </P>
        <br>
        <p>During the entire construction cycle of a building for example, the work will start with the foundation stage and move through to the framing, exterior, drywall and the finishing stage. Depending on what is being built, these stages may differ and there may even be more or fewer stages.
            Construction is a team project and requires a lot of working together. A construction project may require a very large or small workforce, depending on the size of the building project. No matter what the size is, there are lots of different jobs to do, requiring many different skills.
            On a construction site, each person is responsible for doing their own job using their own skills. On one construction site there could be over 50 men and women all doing different jobs such as a roofer, engineer, electrician, plumber and many more. Not all the members of the workforce will be based on site either; some may be driving on the road delivering supplies or back at the office planning the construction.
            </p>
            <br>
        <p>Because there can be a lot of people working on a construction site at one time, there is a lot going on all at once. Building also requires many different types of equipment, ranging from small tools to large equipment such as vehicles. If not used correctly, both of these types of equipment can be very dangerous to the person using it and also everyone else around them. This is why safety is always the primary focus on a construction site.
            Construction is an exciting environment. Have a look around next time you are out and about and discover how it is shaping the world around you for the future
